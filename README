SitLog - Situation and Logic
----------------------------

This is a declarative situation-oriented logical language for programming
situated service robot’s tasks. SitLog can also be seen as a behavior 
engineering specification formalism to support action selection by autonomous 
agents during the execution of complex tasks. The language combines the 
Recursive Transition Network formalism, extended with functions to express 
dynamic and contextualized task structure, with a functional language to 
express control and content information. SitLog’s programs are expressed in
the standard Prolog’s notation permitting the declarative specification and
direct interpretation of complex applications in a modular and compact form.

Installation
------------
Read INSTALL for detailed instructions.  

Execution
---------

Execute the following command to run dummy example:

  $ ./scripts/paper test

Note: The execution log appears into dm.log inside apps/paper/

Execute the following command to run the 'Clean Up' RoboCup@Home 2012 rulebook application:

  $ ./scripts/robocup2012 test

The expectations appears every time but the value of variables depends on KB.pl and values given by the user.

A recommended interaction is as follow:

  |: open.
  |: arrive.
  |: room(kitchen).
  |: arrive.
  |: object([[coke,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1],[mineral,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]]).
  |: stopped.
  |: object.
  |: object([[mineral,1,1,1,1,1,1,1,1]]).
  |: stopped.
  |: object.
  |: arrive.
  |: arrive.

The execution log appears into dm.log inside apps/robocup2012/
